# Standalone script to process campaigns and populate campaign_customers
# This script would need to:
# 1. Initialize settings (app.core.config.settings)
# 2. Initialize DB session (app.db.session.SessionLocal)
# 3. Query for campaigns that need processing (e.g., status 'active', not yet processed)
# 4. For each campaign, call a service function (e.g., from app.services.campaign_processing_service)
#    that implements the logic to find matching customers and populate campaign_customers table.

# Example structure:
# import sys
# import os
# sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

# from app.db.session import SessionLocal
# from app.services.campaign_processing_service import process_campaign_customers
# from app import crud # To fetch campaigns

# def main():
#     db = SessionLocal()
#     try:
#         # Fetch campaigns to process (e.g., all active ones)
#         campaigns_to_process = crud.campaign.get_multi(db, limit=1000) # Add filtering
#         for campaign in campaigns_to_process:
#             print(f"Processing campaign: {campaign.name} (ID: {campaign.id})")
#             # process_campaign_customers(db, campaign_id=campaign.id)
#             print(f"Finished processing campaign: {campaign.name}")
#     finally:
#         db.close()

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
pass
